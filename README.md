# Machine Learning models to predict response to DMARD treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients using lipid mediator profiles
## Overview: 
This repository contains the **R scripts** used to create the machine learning models used to predict the response to DMARD treatment in rheumatoid arthiritis patients using lipid mediators profiles, clinical scores, specific lipid mediator families and separating the data based on the pathotype showed by the patients. 
Besides that, it also contains the scripts used for the validation step of the models (using a validation cohort) and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) calculation. 
Finally, it also contains a small script that was used to do the differential gene expression analysis of the ALOX12, ALOX5, ALOX15 and ALOX15B enzymes. 
**NOTE:** **MetaboAnalyst** (more information [here](https://www.metaboanalyst.ca//faces/ModuleView.xhtml)) software was used to perform some statistical analyses such as partial least squares-discrimination analysis (PLS-DA), orthagonal partial least squares-discrimination analysis (oPLS-DA), variance importance in projection analysis (VIP). For the network analyses, [**Cytoscape software**](https://cytoscape.org/) (version 3.7.1) was used.
